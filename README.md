# Code Log

Hello, world! 🌍

My name is Alexandra Larrabee, and I’ve recently completed coding bootcamp! I’m excited to start this new chapter of my life and decided to start a coding log. This will be my way of continuing to learn, grow, and sharpen my skills while I search for my next opportunity in the tech industry. I’ve already got a personal project or two in mind that I can’t wait to dive into.

With fall coming up I'm looking forward to coding through the shorter days with many anticipated cups of tea (or coffee) and my favorite lofi playlists streaming in the background.

This log will document my daily progress, challenges, and milestones I reach along the way. Here’s to learning and creating!

Feel free to follow along, and let’s connect if you’re also on a coding journey!
