### Day 01: August 20th, 2024
**Today's Progress:** Created repository for portfolio. Initialized Vite for React project setup. Installed necessary dependencies including React, ReactDOM, and Vite plugins.


### Day 02: August 21st, 2024
**Today's Progress:** Started a new course called "Git for Distributed Software Development" through Verizon/edX. Chapters 1-4 of 13 chapters have been completed:
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Git
- Chapter 2: Git Installation
- Chapter 3: Git and Revision Control Systems
- Chapter 4: Using Git: An Example

Topics covered included a general overview of Git. How to install Git (with Linux - I currently have Windows and use Git Bash). Revision control systems. Basic git commands. Setting up a repository, making changes and commits.

**Thoughts:** During my coding bootcamp, I gained a basic understanding of Git as part of my coursework. I found myself utilizing Git more frequently than many of my peers, and I often helped others learn key Git operations such as pulling, pushing, creating branches, and making commits. My goal is to gain more hands-on experience using Git and the command line so I can better understand version control and how I can use it to assist in troubleshooting and optimizing my workflow.
